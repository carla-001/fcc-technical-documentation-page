**Certificate:** Responsive Web Design

## README
The Technical Documentation Page is a lean and introductory cascading style sheets "how to" guide that explains the use, functionality, and creation of css.

## Project Criteria
Build a technical documentation page using HTML and plain CSS. Fulfill the below user stories:<br>
(full stories available in ***Link*** posted above)<br>
1. add an element with id="main-doc", which contains the page's main content.
2. within the #main-doc element, add several section elements  with the class="main-section". There should be a minimum of 5.
3. within each .main-section add a header element which contains text to describes the topic of that section.
4. add an id to each section element (with class="main-section") that corresponds with the text of each header. Any spaces should be replaced with underscores (e.g. The section that contains the header "JavaScript and Java" should have a corresponding id="JavaScript_and_Java").
5. add at least 10 'p' elements in total to the .main-section elements (not each).
6. add at least 5 code elements in total to the .main-section elements (not each).
7. add at least 5 'li' items in total to the .main-section elements (not each).
8. add a 'nav' element with id="navbar".
9. within the navbar element, add 1 header element to describe the topic of the technical documentation.
10. within the navbar element, add an 'a' link elements with class=" nav-link" for every class="main-section" element.
11. within the navbar, the header element must come before any 'a' link elements.
12. each nav-link's text should correspond to the header text within each section(e.g. if section/header is "Hello world", then navbar should have an element which contains the text "Hello world").
13. when a navbar element is clicked, the page should navigate to the corresponding section of the main-doc element (e.g. If a nav-link element that contains the text "Hello world" is clicked, then the page navigates to a section element that has that id and contains the corresponding header.
14. On regular sized devices (laptops, desktops), the element with id="navbar"should be shown on the left side of the screen and should always be visible to the user.
15. use at least one media query.
